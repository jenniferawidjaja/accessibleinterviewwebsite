Milestone III

What is our project:
Our project focuses on developing an interview question preparation website tailored to
help individuals confidently navigate job interviews. The website's primary goal is to provide
comprehensive resources and guidance for users to effectively answer interview questions and
excel in their job search endeavors.

Features Implemented:
To make the website accessible to users with hearing, visual, and mobility impairments,
we implemented the following features:

1. Voice Out Loud Feature: Users have the option to select the volume icon in order to listen to
the interview preparation question and receive tips for answering it, as it's read aloud.This not
only promotes independence in navigating the website but also addresses diverse learning
preferences, allowing users to absorb information through auditory channels.
2. Keyboard Navigation: Individuals with mobility impairments who depend on keyboard-only
navigation can seamlessly interact with all interactive elements on the website without facing
any obstacles. They achieve this by navigating through the page using the tab key and
activating elements by pressing the Enter key.
3. High Contrast Mode: Our website intentionally utilizes a color theme consisting of blue,
white, gray, and black to reduce the cognitive load and facilitate content comprehension for
users with visual impairments. This careful selection ensures sufficient color contrast between
foreground and background elements, enhancing readability and usability for all users, including
those with visual impairments or color vision deficiencies.
4. Test resize: Our website allows users with varying degrees of visual impairment to adjust the
content text size to a comfortable level, promoting readability and accessibility of content.
Changes: We opted not to include descriptive alt text at the end because we chose to update
the text directly in the HTML instead of using images. Since the questions are presented as
HTML rather than images, we decided to remove this feature.

Further steps if given more time:
1. Voice out loud speed and tone customization: If given more time, we would enable
users to adjust the speed and tone of the read-aloud feature. This would allow users to
customize the interview preparation experience based on their preferences and needs,
thereby enabling users with different language comprehension processing speeds to use
our website.
2. Color contrast customization: If given more time, we would enable users to adjust the
color contrast beyond high contrast mode to suit their individual preferences and needs.
If we could allow users to fine-tune the color contrast settings, we could empower them
to create a visual environment that best accommodates their specific visual impairments
or preferences.
3. Single Button input: If given more time, we would allow users to access the entire
website only by pressing a single key on their keyboard. By pressing the spacebar, users
activate scan lines that move across the screen horizontally and vertically. When they
press the spacebar again to stop the scan lines, a click is triggered at the location where
the lines intersect, allowing users to interact with the website without needing a mouse.
4. User flashcard customization: If given more time, we would allow our website to be
able to receive user input so that they can create their own flashcards with their own
questions and tips. This would enable them to tailor the questions toward whichever
industry or job role they are recruiting for
5. Browser compatibility: If given more time, we would conduct thorough testing of our
website across different browsers and assistive technologies to ensure compatibility and
optimal accessibility. This would help us identify and address any accessibility barriers
that may arise during development.
6. Responsive Design: If given more time, we would Optimize the website's layout and
design for various screen sizes and devices. This ensures that users can comfortably
access and interact with the website on different devices, including smartphones and
tablets.

Changes we would make looking back during development:

If we could go back and make changes to how we chose to develop this project, we
would prioritize user testing and feedback incorporation by adopting a systematic approach to
accommodate specific types of disabilities one at a time.We would identify and prioritize a
particular disability type, such as visual impairments or hearing impairments, based on research
and user demographics. Next, we would design and implement accessibility features tailored to
address the specific needs and challenges of users within that disability group. Once the
accessibility features are implemented, we would conduct extensive user testing with individuals
who have the targeted disability. This would involve observing users interact with the website,
collecting feedback on their experience, and identifying any usability issues or accessibility
barriers. Based on the insights gathered from user testing, we would iterate on the design and
implementation of accessibility features to address any identified issues and improve the overall
user experience. This iterative process ensures that the website is effectively accessible to
users with the prioritized disability type. After validating the accessibility improvements with
users from the targeted disability group, we would proceed to accommodate users with other
disabilities in a similar manner, repeating the process of design, implementation, testing, and
iteration.

We believe that adopting an iterative approach to development offers 2 advantages.
Firstly, it ensures that we are building the necessary features for our target audience. By
continuously testing and gathering feedback, we can identify and prioritize the most impactful
features that address specific user needs. Secondly, this approach allows us to enhance and
refine our work over time. Through iteration and refinement based on user feedback, we can
continuously improve the user experience and ensure that the website remains relevant and
effective. On the other hand, without user testing, our initial approach relies entirely on
assumptions regarding necessary features and may not accurately meet the genuine market
demands. By systematically prioritizing and accommodating specific types of disabilities one at
a time, we can ensure that the accessibility features are robust and tailored to the needs of each
user group. This approach allows for more effective user testing, faster adoption of accessibility
features, and ultimately, a more inclusive and user-friendly website experience for all users. We
believe adopting this approach would significantly enhance the website's effectiveness and user
engagement within our target audience. By concentrating on addressing one disability type at a
time rather than attempting to tackle all accessibility challenges simultaneously, we can ensure
a more focused and impactful development process.
